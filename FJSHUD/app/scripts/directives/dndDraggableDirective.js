  /**
   * Use the dnd-draggable attribute to make your element draggable
   *
   * Attributes:
   * - dnd-draggable      Required attribute. The value has to be an object that represents the data
   *                      of the element. In case of a drag and drop operation the object will be
   *                      serialized and unserialized on the receiving end.
   * - dnd-selected       Callback that is invoked when the element was clicked but not dragged.
   *                      The original click event will be provided in the local event variable.
   * - dnd-effect-allowed Use this attribute to limit the operations that can be performed. Options:
   *                      - "move": The drag operation will move the element. This is the default.
   *                      - "copy": The drag operation will copy the element. Shows a copy cursor.
   *                      - "copyMove": The user can choose between copy and move by pressing the
   *                        ctrl or shift key. *Not supported in IE:* In Internet Explorer this
   *                        option will be the same as "copy". *Not fully supported in Chrome on
   *                        Windows:* In the Windows version of Chrome the cursor will always be the
   *                        move cursor. However, when the user drops an element and has the ctrl
   *                        key pressed, we will perform a copy anyways.
   *                      - HTML5 also specifies the "link" option, but this library does not
   *                        actively support it yet, so use it at your own risk.
   * - dnd-moved          Callback that is invoked when the element was moved. Usually you will
   *                      remove your element from the original list in this callback, since the
   *                      directive is not doing that for you automatically. The original dragend
   *                      event will be provided in the local event variable.
   * - dnd-copied         Same as dnd-moved, just that it is called when the element was copied
   *                      instead of moved. The original dragend event will be provided in the local
   *                      event variable.
   * - dnd-dragstart      Callback that is invoked when the element was dragged. The original
   *                      dragstart event will be provided in the local event variable.
   * - dnd-type           Use this attribute if you have different kinds of items in your
   *                      application and you want to limit which items can be dropped into which
   *                      lists. Combine with dnd-allowed-types on the dnd-list(s). This attribute
   *                      should evaluate to a string, although this restriction is not enforced.
   * - dnd-disable-if     You can use this attribute to dynamically disable the draggability of the
   *                      element. This is useful if you have certain list items that you don't want
   *                      to be draggable, or if you want to disable drag & drop completely without
   *                      having two different code branches (e.g. only allow for admins).
   *                      **Note**: If your element is not draggable, the user is probably able to
   *                      select text or images inside of it. Since a selection is always draggable,
   *                      this breaks your UI. You most likely want to disable user selection via
   *                      CSS (see user-select).
   *
   * CSS classes:
   * - dndDragging        This class will be added to the element while the element is being
   *                      dragged. It will affect both the element you see while dragging and the
   *                      source element that stays at it's position. Do not try to hide the source
   *                      element with this class, because that will abort the drag operation.
   * - dndDraggingSource  This class will be added to the element after the drag operation was
   *                      started, meaning it only affects the original element that is still at
   *                      it's source position, and not the "element" that the user is dragging with
   *                      his mouse pointer.
